            <h3>Need a New Website</h3>
            <p>Have you ever asked, "Do I really need a website?" 
            If you're looking to build trust with your audience, connect with new customers, or take your business to the next level, you do. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Like a brochure but better:  </strong>
           Websites can introduce services and offerings to prospective customers in stress-free settings at a time that's convenient for the consumer. Having an online presence helps to build brand awareness, trust and open communication with new and returning customers. </p>

            <h3>Website Refresh</h3>
            <p>You have a website, but it no longer looks like the site of your dreams (and it's only been a year since you had it built). Not to worry! I can help you restore you site to it's former glory with a site design update. </p>

            <h3>Site Updates & Maintenance Plan</h3>
            <p>What happens when you have a website, but you don't have the time or the coding skills to update and maintain it?

            <p>
            It can be exciting to build a website for your business; to finally see your products available in your newly created online store or your organization's upcoming events posted on your new online calendar. But what happens after the shine wears off and you're too busy to update the products, add a new blog post or update the event calendar? 

            I can help keep your site up-to-date whether you use Wordpress, Drupal or other.</p>
