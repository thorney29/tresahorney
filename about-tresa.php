<h1>About Me</h1>
 

<p>
 <img src="/images/tresa-in-iceland.jpg" alt="Tresa in Iceland">After having the good fortune to work at some of our nation's top non-profit environmental organizations as a volunteer recruiter, manager and webmaster for over a decade, I decided to change careers to encourage social change on a different level.</p>
 
<p>Today, I work as a freelance web designer building, maintaining, and updating sites using content management systems like Drupal or Wordpress or coded in HTML. </p>
<p>I have additional experience building sites in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Big Commerce. </p>
<p>I look forward to sharing my on-the-ground experience with you to meet your needs, whether you are a non-profit organization, small business owner, or individual looking to grow your online presence. </p>
